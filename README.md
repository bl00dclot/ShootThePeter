Shoot the Peter
created with Anthropic Claude AI


I'll create a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for developing a JavaScript First-Person Shooter (FPS) game:

Project: JavaScript First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game Development Plan

1. Project Setup and Planning
*- Choose development environment
 * - Visual Studio Code recommended
  *- Set up local development server (e.g., Live Server extension)
*- Select game engine/rendering library
  *- Three.js for 3D rendering
  *- Cannon.js for physics simulation
- Define core game mechanics
 * - Single-player scenario
  - Basic enemy AI
  - Simple map design


2. Technical Architecture
- Frontend Technologies
  - HTML5 Canvas
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Three.js for 3D rendering
  - Cannon.js for physics
- Game Structure
  - Main game loop
  - Render management
  - Input handling
  - Game state management

3. Core Game Mechanics Development
a) Player System
- First-person camera setup
- Player movement
  - WASD key controls
  - Mouse look/aim
  - Jumping
  - Sprinting
- Player health system
- Weapon handling
  - Weapon selection
  - Shooting mechanics
  - Reload system

b) Environment Design
- 3D map creation
- Terrain generation
- Collision detection
- Object interaction
- Lighting and shadowing

c) Enemy System
- Basic enemy AI
- Patrol routes
- Detection and aggression mechanics
- Health and damage system
- Spawning mechanism

4. Weapons and Combat
- Weapon types
  - Pistol
  - Assault rifle
  - Shotgun
- Ammunition system
- Damage calculation
- Shooting mechanics
  - Ray casting for hit detection
  - Bullet trajectory
- Weapon recoil and spread

5. User Interface (UI)
- Health display
- Ammunition count
- Weapon selection
- Minimap
- Crosshair
- Game menu
  - Start screen
  - Pause menu
  - Settings

6. Audio Implementation
- Weapon sound effects
- Enemy sounds
- Ambient environment sounds
- Background music
- Sound positioning

7. Performance Optimization
- Efficient rendering techniques
- Frustum culling
- Level of Detail (LOD) implementation
- Minimizing draw calls
- Texture atlasing
- Code splitting

8. Advanced Features (Optional Expansion)
- Multiple enemy types
- Procedural map generation
- Inventory system
- Power-ups
- Advanced AI behavior
- Multiplayer networking

9. Testing and Debugging
- Unit testing for core mechanics
- Performance profiling
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design
- Input handling validation

10. Deployment Preparation
- Webpack for bundling
- Code minification
- Performance optimization
- Potential hosting platforms
  - GitHub Pages
  - Netlify
  - Vercel

11. Potential Challenges to Address
- Complex 3D rendering performance
- Precise collision detection
- Smooth player movement
- Efficient enemy AI
- Memory management

12. Learning Resources
- Three.js documentation
- MDN Web Docs
- Game development forums
- YouTube tutorials on 3D game development

Recommended Development Sequence:
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Implement 3D rendering
3. Create player movement
4. Develop basic weapon mechanics
5. Implement enemy system
6. Add UI and audio
7. Optimize and polish
8. Extensive testing



### Development Commands
- `npm start`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Create production build
- `npm run dev`: Run development build

### Recommended VS Code Extensions
